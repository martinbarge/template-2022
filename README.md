# README template-2021

## Introduction

This repository is a basic template with which you can build your own website. You can consider it a boilerplate, or set of ready-coded files that you can customise for your own purposes. 

The underlying template design uses a website building framework known as <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap 5</a>. Learning Bootstrap is quite complicated, but I will introduce you to some of the basics. You can learn more about it yourself at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5//">W3Schools Boostrap 5 Tutorials</a>.

The template provided here implements Bootstrap within the conventions of GitHub Pages, and uses the file structures of GitHub Pages to ease the process of publishing your pages. GitHub pages are generated by software known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)">Jekyll</a>, which generates the webpages for you. So, once you have this template set up, you can focus on creating your content.

## How to use

Look closely at the files in this repository. 

You will see a number of files are named with the .html file extension. That is: **index.html**, **page2.html** … **page5.html**. 

### About the HTML files

* These files are the pages of your website. You write your HTML directly into these files, so it's a great way to learn basic HTML coding.  But you will only need to use tags for the body of the document. E.G.: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<hr>`, `<img>`, `<video>`, `<iframe>` etc..

* When you edit the .html files, you are only editing the content for the BODY part of your pages. Jekyll will then automatically insert this into the BODY section of your page template, and publish them into fully formed HTML documents. 

* The big advantage of working in this way is that editing these files won't affect the architecture and structure of your main HTML template. However, it's important to be aware of renaming these files. 

* Open one of the HTML files and you will see this entry at the top: 


  &#45; &#45; &#45; 
  layout: default
  title: home
  &#45; &#45; &#45;
  
  
  You **must** include this entry at the top of every HTML page. Why? Because this tells the page to use the Default template file and is used by the website engine to apply the template to the page. If you make a mistake with this part, your page won't display correctly. Try changing it to see what happens!

### Other essential files

1. **HTML Template** : The HTML template file of your site is named **default.html** and is located in the **&#95;layouts** folder. You won't need to edit the HTML template at all - unless, of course, you want to get into deeper levels of customisation.

2. **navbar** : The navigation bar for the website is a file named **navbar.html** and is located in the **&#95;includes** folder. You will need to edit this file to reflect the names of your pages and the labels of the navigation buttons.

3. **Stylesheet** : In the folder **assets/css**, you will find the **style.scss** file. .scss is a varient of css and works in the same way. You can edit this file to create custom styles for your site. For example, you will be able to change the colours of your banner, set the fonts, and make any other style adjustments you choose.

4. **images** : This is the directory to store your image files. Inside the images folder you can find a **readme.md** file explaining how to use this directory.

5. **Config file** : Finally, the **&#95;config.yml** file is a configuration file, where you modify the settings for your site. You also use this file to set the mappings for your pages to the navigation bar.

## How to Import for your own use

First copy <a href="https://github.com/martinbarge/template-2022">the URL to this repository</a>.
Next, go to the small plus + sign at the top right-hand corner of your GitHub account, and under the plus sign, select 'Import repository'.

Then, paste the URL into the box where it is written, 'Your old repository’s clone URL'. Also, at this point, give a name to the repository where it says 'Your new repository details'. Then click the 'Begin import' button.

Once the import is completed, you will see a link to your new repository. You will also receive an email notification. 

Finally, you must tell GitHub to use your new template. To do this, go to your repository **Settings** (cog wheel icon) and then the **Pages** entry on the left menu; then, under the **Source** section, change the **Branch** from **gh-pages** to **main**. Then click **Save**.   

Now you can edit the files to make your own website.
